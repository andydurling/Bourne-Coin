Community currency for Eastbourne, UK.
Eastbourne is a prosperous coastal community in East Sussex, England. But it also has areas of economic deprivation, and has huge disparities of income and wealth as well as being located in an area where biodiversity collapse, plastic pollution and increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change are increasingly evident. Given this, a community currency that has built-in incentives for local people to engage in transactions that lead to positive social and ecological outcomes is a necessary complement to the fiat currency monetary system.
